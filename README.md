I learned Java by making cheats for Minecraft. Genius.

This mod runs on [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net), and requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).

# Use
***NOTICE***: BrightCraft was just made for fun on singleplayer worlds or servers that support cheating. BrightCraft
was *not* made for use on public servers (e.g. Hypixel) and will *certainly* get you banned (BrightCraft doesn't have
many anticheat bypasses). Please don't ruin other peoples' fun with these cheats.
## Cheats
- NoClip (Only works on COMPLETELY vanilla servers & singleplayer)
- Fly
- NoFallDamage
- FastBreak
- FullBright
- XRay

## Other Features
- GUI to customize/toggle cheats (Open from in-game settings or RSHIFT)
- Keybinds to toggle cheats (Change from the in-game controls settings)
- When cheats are toggled, BrightCraft notifies you in-chat (Of course, only you can see that chat)
- Whenever you join a world/server, BrightCraft tells you what cheats are currently enabled in-chat
